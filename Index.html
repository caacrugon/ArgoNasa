      <p>
        We tackle the "A World Away" challenge by translating complex light-curve data into intuitive stories. Our platform guides
        volunteers through the hunt: from signal cleaning and transit identification to AI-assisted candidate grading and science-ready reports.

      <ul class="highlights">
        <li>
          <span>AI Co-Pilot</span>
          Hybrid neural filters spotlight likely exoplanet transits while surfacing confidence metrics anyone can interpret.
        </li>
        <li>
          <span>Citizen Science Workflow</span>
          Guided missions turn raw TESS and Kepler data into community-driven discoveries, complete with learning badges and feedback loops.
        </li>
        <li>
          <span>Insight Hub</span>
          A storytelling dashboard combines visual analytics, mission milestones, and exportable summaries for judges and partner scientists.
